# LP

This repository contains two projects written in different programming languages: Lisp and Prolog. Each project focuses on a specific functionality as described below:

## Lisp Project: Spirograph Generator and Display

The Lisp project provides functionality to generate and display spirographs. Spirographs are mathematical curves drawn by a point moving around the circumference of a fixed circle while another fixed point within it rotates.

## Prolog Project: Nonogram Generator and Solver

The Prolog project allows you to generate and solve nonograms. Nonograms, also known as Picross or Griddlers, are grid-based puzzles where you reveal a hidden picture by filling in cells based on given clues for each row and column.
